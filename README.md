# adaptive-comp

Source code to simulate a data collection based on adaptive and uniform semantic-driven pairwise comparisons.

The code requires *python 3*.
The required dependencies are *numpy*, *random*, *scipy.stats*, *pandas* (> 1.0.0), *copy*, and *time*.

To launch the simulation, the user can type the command `python3 semantic_comparisons.py` inside the directory *adaptive_comp* and choose the underlying similarity distribution when prompted.

To change the parameters, the user can edit accordingly the top lines of *semantic_comparisons.py*.
